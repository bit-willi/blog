# Enable Compact Mode in Firefox

I always loved tiny GUIs and use Firefox as my go-to browser. However, for some reason, Firefox removed the 'compact' density option from the 'Customize Firefox' menu.
If you're like me and prefer a minimal interface, you can enable this mode again and reclaim some precious screen space. Hereâ€™s how:

## Steps to Enable Compact Mode
1. Open Firefox and type `about:config` in the address bar.
2. Press Enter, then click on "Accept the Risk and Continue" to access the advanced settings.
3. In the search bar at the top of the about:config page, type `browser.compactmode.show`.
4. Set the `browser.compactmode.show` preference to true by clicking the toggle button.

Once you've done this, you can go to the Firefox menu, select "More Tools" > "Customize Toolbar," and you'll see the compact mode option under "Density."

Now you can breathe a sigh of relief as you've reclaimed some pixels and made your browser interface more compact and efficient.
