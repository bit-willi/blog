# Back to the Gym


At the end of last year (2023), I joined a gym. Three months later, I quit, due to some reasons and the place itself.

Now, I'm back, in another gym, with a different workflow, and I want to stay committed.

So, I'm making a public commitment: If I don't go to the gym every day, I'll shave my head.
