# Hello world


From now on, I'm going to start writing texts here. It's a way to force myself to learn in public, and if it's useful to anyone in the future, it's been worth it.

I've been using [neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg) to takes notes during my days. I'll bring some of the most useful as a post here.
