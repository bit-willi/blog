# Pomodoro: Boosting My Productivity


Some time ago, I was looking for ways to improve my productivity. That's when I found [James Scholz's](https://www.youtube.com/@JamesScholz) YouTube channel and fell in love with his discipline.

I had tried the Pomodoro Technique a few years ago but never succeeded—I never managed to stick with it for more than a day. This time, I was determined to try really hard. And guess what? I succeeded!

I now work for 60 minutes and rest for 10 minutes. During my breaks, I do some stretches, read a few pages of a book, or watch a YouTube video. When I'm in my 60 minutes of work, I focus solely on my tasks. This routine has made me incredibly productive; I’m writing code like never before!


## Note Taking

After every Pomodoro session, I document my progress with the following format:

```markdown
YYYY-MM-DD
- HH:MM - X/10 -> NOTES.
- HH:MM - X/10 -> NOTES.
```

I write these notes after each session and give a score from 1 to 10 for every session. This helps me understand how I work best and what affects my productivity.


## Time Tracking

For time tracking, I use an Android application called [Goodtime](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.apps.adrcotfas.goodtime/). It's a very minimalistic app that perfectly meets my needs. I leave my phone on my desk in focus mode with this app running as a 'clock' to keep me on track.

By incorporating the Pomodoro Technique into my daily routine, I've managed to enhance my productivity and maintain a consistent workflow. If you're looking for a way to boost your productivity, I highly recommend giving Pomodoro another try—it's been a game-changer for me!
