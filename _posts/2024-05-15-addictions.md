# Addiction
I've been working 14-hour days but haven't felt productive for the past few weeks. After careful consideration, I discovered the root of the problem: my serotonin-driven addictions.

## Smartphone
I've never been a heavy social media user, but TikTok was an exception. I could scroll for hours without realizing it, so I uninstalled it once I recognized this issue. The allure of short videos kept me hooked, often consuming minutes or even hours of my time. Recognizing the need for change, I took action.
I uninstalled everything from my phone except essential communication apps and X (formerly Twitter). Additionally, I turned my screen to grayscale and only use my smartphone when absolutely necessary.

## Desktop
On my desktop, I also removed colors, enabling grayscale only on necessary sites. Everything else remains in gray. These two extensions help me stay focused:

- [Grayscale the Web](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/grayscale-the-web-save-si/mblmpdpfppogibmoobibfannckeeleag)
- [DF Youtube](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/df-tube-distraction-free/mjdepdfccjgcndkmemponafgioodelna)

With these changes and by doing Pomodoro sessions (60 minutes of work, 10 minutes of rest), I was able to work longer and get more done in the same amount of time.

It's not about completely avoiding YouTube or random videos, but about indulging in them when I choose to, not out of habit.

I'm not naturally disciplined, so I need to force myself onto the right path.
