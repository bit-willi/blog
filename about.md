Hi, I'm Willian, I'm 19 years old and I love programming and open source.<br>
I've been programming for the web for two years using PHP, JS, HTML and CSS, 
I tried to do some things in the gnome environment, but it took a long time to learn,
so I had to leave to study to work, but in the future I will learn that, I promise.
